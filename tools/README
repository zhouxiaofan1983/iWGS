These scripts help to automate the acquisition and installation of most third-party software tool dependencies of iWGS.

Please note:

1: make sure to use the script that matches with your operation system (Linux or MacOS). Some of the tools have pre-compiled executables that are platform specific, and several tools are not available on Mac OS;
2: some genome assemblers (e.g. ABYSS, ALLPATHS-LG, DISCOVAR, FALCON, and SGA) have particular requirements, therefore the script will download the package without performing the actual installation;
3: to customize the selection of tools to download/install, please modify the top section of the script to comment (or comment out) the corresponding lines.
