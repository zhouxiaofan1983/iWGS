    Modifications based on release version 1.0.3.

    * Changed:
        The average read accurary now follows a Weibull distribution in
	model-based simulation.
    * Changed:
        A new model of quality code learned from recent PacBio (P5C3; A. lyrata)
	data is used for model-based simulation.

    Release Version 1.0.3.

    * Added function:
        In order to reproduce the output of PBSIM, "--seed" option was added.

    Release Version 1.0.2.

    * Added function:
        Samples (specified by --sample-fastq) were able to be reused.
        --sample-profile-id was added and
        --fastq was renamed to --sample-fastq.
    * Changed:
        Multi-FASTA files were able to be acceptable for --sample-fastq.
    * Changed:
        The range of coverage depth (specified by --depth) was changed
        to be from 0 to the maximum integer size, and any float number
        is acceptable.

    Release Version 1.0.1.

    * Changed:
        The output format of read positions in the reference sequence
        was changed to MAF.
    * Fixed bug:
        The swapping between --accuracy-max and --accuracy-min was fixed.
